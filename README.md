# Computation Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) and Universal Source Separation with Weakly labelled Data


1. Prepare running experiment.

```bash
conda create -n casa python=3.8
conda activate casa
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference


## Train from Scratch

0. Download PANNs checkpoints



```bash
./scripts/0_download_checkpoints.sh
```

## Download dataset from ...

The [scripts/1_download_dataset.sh](scripts/1_download_dataset.sh) script is used for downloading all audio and metadata from the internet. The total size of AudioSet is around 1.1 TB. Notice there can be missing files on YouTube, so the numebr of files downloaded by users can be different from time to time. Our downloaded version contains 20550 / 22160 of the balaned training subset, 1913637 / 2041789 of the unbalanced training subset, and 18887 / 20371 of the evaluation subset. 

For reproducibility, our downloaded dataset can be accessed at: link: [https://pan.baidu.com/s/13WnzI1XDSvqXZQTS-Kqujg](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13WnzI1XDSvqXZQTS-Kqujg), password: 0vc2

The downloaded data looks like:

## 2. Pack waveforms into hdf5 files
The [scripts/2_pack_waveforms_to_hdf5s.sh](scripts/2_pack_waveforms_to_hdf5s.sh) script is used for packing all raw waveforms into 43 large hdf5 files for speed up training: one for balanced training subset, one for evaluation subset and 41 for unbalanced traning subset. The packed files looks like:

<pre>
workspace
└── hdf5s
     ├── targets (2.3 GB)
     |    ├── balanced_train.h5
     |    ├── eval.h5
     |    └── unbalanced_train
     |        ├── unbalanced_train_part00.h5
     |        ...
     |        └── unbalanced_train_part40.h5
     └── waveforms (1.1 TB)
          ├── balanced_train.h5
          ├── eval.h5
          └── unbalanced_train
              ├── unbalanced_train_part00.h5
              ...
              └── unbalanced_train_part40.h5
</pre>
